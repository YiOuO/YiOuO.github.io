  abstract = {Wave Energy Converters, particularly point absorbers, have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for harvesting ocean wave energy. Nevertheless, achieving high conversion efficiency remains challenging due to the inherently complex and nonlinear interactions between incident waves and device motion dynamics. This study develops an optimal adaptive damping control model for the power take-off (PTO) system by coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework enables real-time communication between high-fidelity SPH simulations and intelligent control agents that learn coordinated policies to maximise energy capture. In each training episode, the SPH-based environment provides instantaneous hydrodynamic states to the agents, which output continuous damping actions and receive rewards reflecting power absorption. The Multi-Agent Soft Actor Critic algorithm is employed within a centralised-training and decentralised-execution scheme to ensure stable learning in continuous, multi-body systems. The entire platform is implemented in a unified GPU-accelerated C++ environment, allowing long-horizon training and large-scale three-dimensional simulations. The approach is validated through a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmark cases under regular and irregular wave conditions. Compared with constant PTO damping, the learned control policy increases overall energy capture by 23.8\% and 21.5\%, respectively, demonstrating the strong potential of intelligent control for improving the performance of wave energy converter arrays. The developed three-dimensional GPUaccelerated multi-agent platform in computational hydrodynamics, is extendable to other fluid--structure interaction engineering problem that require real-time, multi-body coordinated control.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced version of the well-known SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) open-source code DualSPHysics for the simulation of free-surface fluid flows, leading to the DualSPHysics+ code. The enhancements are made through incorporation of several schemes with respect to stability, accuracy and energy/volume conservation issues in simulating incompressible free-surface fluid flows within the weakly compressible SPH formalism. The Optimized Particle Shifting (OPS) scheme is implemented to improve the accuracy of particle shifting vectors in the free-surface region. To mitigate energy dissipation and maintain consistency, the artificial viscosity in {$\delta$}-SPH is substituted with a Riemann stabilization term, leading to the {$\delta$}R-SPH. The Velocity divergence Error Mitigating (VEM) and Volume Conservation Shifting (VCS) schemes are adopted in DualSPHysics+ to mitigate the velocity divergence error and improve the volume conservation, and hence to enhance the resolution of the continuity equation. To further reduce both the instantaneous and accumulated errors in velocity divergence, a Hyperbolic/Parabolic Divergence Cleaning (HPDC) scheme is incorporated in addition to the VEM scheme. The implementations of the introduced schemes on both CPU and GPU-based versions of the DualSPHysics+ code along with details on the compilation, running and computational performance are presented. Validations in terms of accuracy, energy conservation and convergence of DualSPHysics+ are shown via several relevant benchmarks. It is demonstrated that a better velocity divergence error cleaning in both instantaneous and accumulated errors can be achieved by the combination of VEM and HPDC. Meanwhile, the excessive energy dissipation by the artificial viscosity is shown to be suppressed by adopting the Riemann stabilization term. Enhanced resolution of the continuity equation along with improved energy conservation of DualSPHysics+ advance the SPH-based simulation of incompressible free-surface fluid flows.

Programming language: C++, CUDA. External dependencies: DualSPHysics (https://dual.sphysics.org). Nature of problem: Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) method and the open-source code DualSPHysics have been widely applied to simulate free-surface fluid flows. Both the general WCSPH method and the more specific DualSPHysics need further improvements in several aspects, including spurious pressure fluctuations, non-conservation of volume and excessive energy dissipation, to enhance the accuracy and stability of simulations. Solution method: DualSPHysics+ implements a set of numerical schemes to enhance the overall accuracy, divergence-free velocity field, invariant density field and energy conservation in the simulation of free-surface fluid flows based on DualSPHysics.},

  abstract = {Wave-structure interaction (WSI) is a fundamental problem in coastal and ocean engineering. In this paper, an enhanced numerical wave tank for WSI simulations (including both rigid and elastic structures) is developed based on the open-source Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) software DualSPHysics+. The {$\delta$}-SPH density diffusion term is combined with a Riemann-based dissipation term ({$\delta$}R-SPH) to mitigate unphysical energy dissipation and thereby reduce wave attenuation. To suppress numerical pressure oscillations during the WSI process, the combination of Hyperbolic/Parabolic Divergence Cleaning (HPDC) and Velocity Divergence Error Mitigation (VEM) is adopted. The Volume Conservation Shifting (VCS) scheme is employed to enhance volume conservation during long-distance wave propagation, while the Optimized Particle Shifting (OPS) scheme is incorporated to improve the distribution of free surface particles. To improve the reliability of the structural model, the momentum equation is discretized to second order. A dynamic hourglass control scheme and Riemann stabilization term are implemented to suppress spurious zero-energy modes. The developed numerical wave tank is validated against multiple two- and three-dimensional benchmark examples. By incorporating the enhanced schemes in both fluid and structural fields, the processes of wave generation, propagation, and interaction with the structure can be reproduced with higher accuracy and enhanced physical consistency.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced hydroelastic FSI (Fluid-Structure Interaction) solver based on the open-source SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) code DualSPHysics+. For the structure model, a second-order discretization of the deformation gradient tensor (F2nd) is implemented to improve the accuracy of stress and strain computation. To mitigate numerical noises in the reproduced stress fields and improve numerical stability, a Riemann Stabilization (RS) term is incorporated in the structural momentum equation. A Dynamic Hourglass Control (DHGC) scheme being parameter-free is proposed to mitigate the spurious zero-energy modes linked with rank deficiency as a challenging issue for collocated computational methods including the total Lagrangian SPH. The novelty of this scheme is that it dynamically adjusts the hourglass control coefficient based on the instantaneous state of particle distributions and time evolution of an error function. For the fluid model, the Velocity divergence Error Mitigating (VEM) scheme and Hyperbolic/Parabolic Divergence Cleaning (HPDC) scheme are adopted to suppress spurious fluid pressure noises and hence enhance the modelling of fluid-structure interactions. Validations in terms of robustness and accuracy of the proposed model are carried out via five structure examples and three FSI ones. The results demonstrate that more physically consistent stress and strain fields are reproduced by the implementation of F2nd and RS. The proposed DHGC scheme effectively suppresses hourglass modes and is case- and resolutionindependent (in contrast to the traditional Hourglass Control scheme). The incorporation of the VEM and HPDC mitigates fluid pressure noises and further enhances the accuracy of FSI simulations.},
