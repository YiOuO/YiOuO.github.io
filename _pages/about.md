I'm a final year PhD student in Marine Technology and Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) under the supervision of [Prof. Min Luo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/minluo). I'm currently a visiting scholar at the [University of Vigo](https://www.uvigo.gal/en) in Spain, working with [Prof. Alejandro J. C. Crespo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L4dD9AIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My research interests lie at the intersection of computational fluid dynamics, high performance computing, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I focus on:
- **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)** methods for fluid-structure interaction problems
- **High Performance Computing (HPC)** with GPU parallelization for large-scale simulations
- **Reinforcement Learning in Computational Fluid Dynamics (RLCFD)** for intelligent flow control
